## DeepLabcut
During the workshop, you'll use DeepLabCut to track apes' hands by setting up the training of your own network.

After installation is completed, check if it works using the instructions (1)

## Trajectory Analysis
After using DeepLabCut, you'll analyze the hand trajectories by writing a Python script.
You will fill-in the HandTracking_Fill_In_The_Gap.py file with the help of the presenters Raphaëlle Malassis and Rayanne Martin.
